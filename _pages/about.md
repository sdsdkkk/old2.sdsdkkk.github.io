I'm **Edwin Tunggawan**, across the Internet I usually use the handle **`sdsdkkk`** unless when it's not available for me to use. I've been working as a software engineer in Indonesian tech startups since I graduated from university in 2013.

Outside work, I usually spend my time exploring topics that interest me. Sometimes it takes a bit more dedication (such as pursuing a master's degree in computer and information security back in 2014-2015), but most of the time it's just me reading books and exploring topics I'm interested in by myself.

Lately I'm trying to revisit mathematics, physics, and statistics materials I used to study since I didn't study hard enough back in high school and college. I kind of regret it now that I have a good idea what I can do with them.

I'm interested in natural science in general, psychology, and history. One of the things I enjoy the most is having an all night long discussion with friends during our community meetups, but sadly our annual community meetup plans haven't been going very well recently.

If you're interested to chat about anything that might interest me, you can find me on the following channels.
